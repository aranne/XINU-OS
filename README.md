# XINU-OS

[An educational OS](https://xinu.cs.purdue.edu): XINU stands for Xinu Is Not Unix -- although it shares concepts and even names with Unix, the internal design differs completely. 

Xinu is a small, elegant operating system that supports dynamic process creation, dynamic memory allocation, network communication, local and remote file systems, a shell, and device-independent I/O functions. The small size makes Xinu suitable for embedded environments.
